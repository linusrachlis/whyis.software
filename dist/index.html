        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>When I first used a computer, the experience was stuffy and arcane, but awe-inspiring. The thing waited for you to figure it out &mdash; or not. Since then, computing has gone mainstream. A few companies have grown massive by making computing into a sleek and magical experience &mdash; except that we grow bored of the magic, as well as distrustful of the never-ending hiccups. It&rsquo;s a strange and perhaps unhealthy relationship.</p>
        <p>I made this site because even if software is not your field, it&rsquo;s a big part of your life. You probably find it curious, maddening, confounding, addicting, and maybe sometimes still awe-inspiring. The truth is there is no magic, just a lot of people working hard, making a mess, and trying to keep it from getting too far out of hand. It affects your life, so you deserve more insight.</p>
        <p>Despite all the attempts to make software sleek and magical, the icebergs of complexity often poke up above the surface, presenting the average user with a head-scratcher. I use these questions as starting points for a brief, high-level answer. Each article has additional questions that you can expand, depending where you&rsquo;re interested in diving deeper.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a software developer in Toronto, ON, Canada. You can also find me at my <a href="https://linus.rachlis.net">strange personal website</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/winnythefoo">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/linusrachlis">Github</a>.</p>
